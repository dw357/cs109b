The Case For Combating Malaria
\end_layout

\size large
Concentrated in the poorest regions of the world, malaria is a leading cause
 of death and ill-health in the developing world.
 It needs our attention,

Malaria situation today
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted
 to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes.
 About 3.2 billion people – almost half of the world’s population – are at
 risk of malaria.
 Young children, pregnant women and non-immune travelers from malaria-free
 areas are particularly vulnerable to the disease when they become infected.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the year 2015, there are a total of 214 million malaria cases reported
 worldwide.
 A look at the regional distribution of malaria cases shows that tropical
 regions are most affected.
 Among all, Africa has the most number of malaria cases compared to the
 rest of the world, contributing to about 90% of total global occurance.
 Within Africa, Nigeria has the most number of malaria cases, more than
 three times that of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which comes in second
 on the list.
 Although the total number of malaria cases in Africa decreased from 2000
 to 2015 due to increasing glocal efforts, Nigeria saw an increase in the
 number of cases from 2010 to 2015, and it remains to be the African country
 most plagued by the disease.
 India also has the most number of malaria cases in Asia, which puts it
 at the third highest on the global malaria cases rank.

Increased funding reduces malaria
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Malaria is preventable and curable.
 Increased efforts are dramatically reducing the malaria burden in many
 places.
 Global funding efforts increased from 4,352 million in year 2005 to 12,894
 million in year 2013.
 This includes domestic resources, global funds, funding from the world
 bank, United States, United Kingdom, as well as numerous other sources.
 Domestic funds increases steadily from year 2005 to year 2013, constituting
 a significant portion of the total monetary efforts towards fighting malaria.
 Global funds increases from the year 2005 to 2009, but saw a dipping after
 2009 possibly due to the global financial crisis affecrting major countires
 around the world.
 However, since 2011, global funding efforts has started to increase again
 and now contributes the most significant part among all funding efforts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The increase in funding saw a significant decrease in the number of malaria
 cases.
 The number of malaria cases in Ski lanka, in particular, has reduced from
 230 million in year 2000 to only 1,800 cases in 2005, removing itself from
 the world malaria map.
 Sri Lanka’s success was a result of concerted investment and efforts from
 both demostic and global organizations.
 Globally, the number of malaria cases has reduced drastically from 263
 million in 2005 to 211 million in 2015, by 20%.
 The global decrease in malaria incidence, which is the number of emerging
 cases per year, has decreased by 37% between 2000 and 2015.
 There is also a 60% decrease in global malaria mortality rate between the
 same time period.
 Increased funding saw a tangible reduction in the number of malaria cases
 across the world.

Shrinking the malaria map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Today we are still faced with hundreds of millions of malaria cases around
 the world.
 There is still a long way to go in the fight against malaria, we are by
 no means near eradicating malaria completely, especially in the developing
 world.
 Nevertheless, it is encouraging and rewarding to see that tremendous amount
 of effort and funding we have put in towards fighting malaria has produced
 tangible results in reducing both the incidence and motality rates.
 With increased investments and sustained effort in this cause, we can no
 doubt accelerate the shrinking of the malaria map and end the disease for
 good.
